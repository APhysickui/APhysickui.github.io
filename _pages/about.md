I’m a first-year undergraduate student in the Department of Physics at Peking University. I’m still exploring my academic interests, but currently I’m curious about condensed matter physics and astrophysics.

I’m just getting started, and there’s still a long way to go — just an ordinary student trying to find my path. I enjoy watching movies and learning new things in computer science in my spare time.
  <!--My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.-->

The website is still under construction. Codes and course notes are uploading quickly.
