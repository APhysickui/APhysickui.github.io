I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), currently enrolled in the 22nd Turing Class. At the same time, I studied for a double degree in economics at the National School of Development.

My research interests and skills are concentrated in the fields of ml, nlp, llms, etc. I currently do not have a supervisor or research group.  <!--My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.-->
